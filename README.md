# Knight's Night Parkour

Knight’s Night Parkour is a 3D platformer Game which is based on the game ‘Knight’s Try’. It is a parkour game with small, moving platforms, guillotines and other obstacles. You can also pet cats. The objective of the game is to jump to other platforms to reach checkpoint, and finally reach the end.

The camera is in third person, and the movement is very basic, with forward, back, left and right controls and a jump action (WASD and Space). If you fall into the void, (players y position goes below 0), or another obstacle hits you (collisions), you respawn at your last checkpoint.
